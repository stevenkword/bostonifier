This is an awesome plugin that translates English into Bostonian. It was created as an example for presentation at WordCamp Boston 2017.

It was scaffolded inside of VVV using WP-CLI's scaffold command.  It contains an
example of a good testable function with a corresponding unit test. It has also been
configured to integrate with TravisCI via this plugin's GitHub repository.

The results of the automated tests running with TravisCI can be seen above.
